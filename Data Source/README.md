## Data Source
I've only included **sample CSV files** of the raw and cleaned trip data.  
The full Cyclistic dataset is too large to upload to GitHub, but it can be accessed directly from  
[Divvyâ€™s trip data archive](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).  

I used the complete 12 months of 2024 data for the analysis, but included smaller samples here so it's is easy to explore.
