# Cyclistic Case Study

This project analyzes Cyclistic's bike-share data to compare how annual members and casual riders use the service. The goal was to find patterns in rider behavior and suggest recommendations that could encourage more casual riders to become members.  

## What's inside
- Sample CSV files with both the raw and cleaned trip data  
- SQL queries I wrote to pull the data I needed for the analysis  
- Charts showing trends by month, day of week, and time of day  
- Key findings about how members and casual riders use Cyclistic differently  
- Recommendations for how Cyclistic could encourage more casual riders become members
